# NFC Payment System Documentation

This project aims to develop an NFC payment system that allows users to make payments using NFC-enabled devices. Additionally, it will serve as a third-party application for POS agents to accept NFC payments.

## Project Overview

The project consists of the following components:

1. **Web App**: Allows users to make payments using NFC technology via web browsers.
2. **Backend System**: Handles user authentication, payment processing, and interacts with POS systems.
3. **Integration with POS Systems**: Acts as a third-party application to enable POS agents to accept NFC payments.

## Team Members

- Frontend Developer: [Name]
- Backend Developer 1: [Name]
- Backend Developer 2: [Name]

## Tasks Distribution

### Frontend Developer:
- Develop web interfaces for user interaction.
- Implement NFC payment functionality on the web.

### Backend Developers:
- Set up backend infrastructure.
- Develop APIs for authentication, payment processing, and POS integration.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**:
  - HTML, CSS, JavaScript (or frameworks like React.js, Angular, Vue.js)
  
- **Backend**:
  - Node.js, Django, Flask, or Spring Boot
  - Database: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, etc.
  
- **NFC Integration**:
  - For web: NFC libraries compatible with web browsers.
  - For backend: NFC libraries compatible with your backend technology.
  
- **POS Integration**:
  - Depends on POS system APIs or SDKs provided by POS vendors.

## Steps to Implement

1. **Requirement Gathering**: Define detailed requirements and system interactions.
2. **Design Phase**: Design database schema, API contracts, and UI.
3. **Development**: Implement frontend, backend, NFC integration, and POS integration.
4. **Testing**: Perform unit tests, integration tests, and NFC payment testing.
5. **Deployment**: Deploy backend services and web app.
6. **Monitoring and Maintenance**: Monitor system performance and handle maintenance.

## Considerations

- **Security**: Ensure secure communication and data encryption.
- **Compliance**: Adhere to payment industry standards.
- **Scalability**: Design system to handle growing user base.
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling mechanisms.
- **User Experience**: Focus on intuitive UI/UX design.

## How to Run
